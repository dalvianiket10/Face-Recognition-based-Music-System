# Face Recognition Based Music System

## Overview
The Face Recognition Music System is a Python-based application that identifies users via facial recognition and plays music tailored to their preferences or mood. The project integrates OpenCV, deep learning, and SQL Server for data management.

## Features
- Detects user faces using OpenCV.
- Analyzes facial expressions to determine mood.
- Plays music based on recognized user preferences.
- SQL Server integration for music library management.

## Tools & Technologies
- Programming Language: Python  
- Database: SQL Server  
- Libraries/Frameworks: OpenCV, Deep Learning Models  

## Responsibilities
- Implemented facial recognition using OpenCV and deep learning tools.
- Analyzed facial expressions for mood detection with high accuracy.
- Coordinated team tasks and ensured timely delivery of project milestones.

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dalvianiket10/Face-Recognition-Music-System.git
   ```
2. Install required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Set up the SQL Server database with the provided schema file.
4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Future Scope
- Improve facial expression recognition accuracy.
- Add integration with online music platforms like Spotify or YouTube.
- Implement voice control features for hands-free interaction.
